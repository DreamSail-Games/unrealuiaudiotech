To build the sample plugins on android you need to use make. 
The makefile is dependant on the android ndk standalone toolchains.
The toolchains can be generated by running the following shell script:

SDK/source/Build/Android/MakeStandaloneToolchain.sh

Once the standalone toolchains are generated, you will need to call makefile with the following arguments

make -f SamplePluginsAndroid.make WWISE_SDK_ROOT=[PATH TO WWISE SDK ROOT] ANDROID_PLATFORM=android-9 ANDROID_ARCH=[ANDROID ARCH]

PATH TO WWISE SDK ROOT: Must be absolute path, starting with root drive letter and forward slash as path separator.
ANDROID ARCH: armeabi or armeabi-v7a

For example if your Wwise SDK is installed in D:\Wwise then you can call make like this:
make -f SamplePluginsAndroid.make WWISE_SDK_ROOT=D:/WWise/SDK ANDROID_PLATFORM=android-9 ANDROID_ARCH=armeabi
